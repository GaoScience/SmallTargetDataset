Detecting and tracking small moving targets with extremely low SCR in complex scenarios have important applications in aerospace and traffic management. We have released a dataset containing visible light data, infrared data, and astronomical data. The SCR of the targets in the dataset is below 1.5, providing relevant scholars with materials for research. The dataset includes seven image sequences, each recording the movement of small targets with extremely low SCR.

- **Sequence 1** records the movement of a tank model on the ground captured by a visible light camera, with a tree in the scene as clutter.
- **Sequence 2** shows the movement of a small drone in a complex background captured by a visible light camera, with mountains, buildings, and trees in the background.
- **Sequence 3** involves the movement of a target among clouds. Because targets in the clouds are difficult to capture, moving targets were added frame by frame to the cloud background captured by the visible light camera.
- **Sequences 4 and 5** display the flight of an airplane over an airport captured by a mid-wave infrared camera. Sequence 4 includes one airplane, while Sequence 5 includes two airplanes.
- **Sequence 6** depicts the movement of an asteroid captured with a telescope at an observatory.
- **Sequence 7** shows the movement of six airplanes over an airport captured by a mid-wave infrared camera.
